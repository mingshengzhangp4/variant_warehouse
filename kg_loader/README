This is also a loader expected to work on 1000Genomes data, albeit much faster and simpler.
In order to use it, you need to install www.github.com/paradigm4/load_tools

It exhibits a slightly more general schema. 
It does not require high numbers of threads or as much pre-processing. 
Currently it assumes that
 - the first VCF loaded will contain all the samples in the SAMPLE line
 - every other VCF loaded will contain the same samples in the same positions
 - no two VCFs have the same variant listed
That is the case with the 1K genomes data.

It is possible to append both: new samples and new variants. No conceptual difficulty.
Those queries will need to use index_lookup more often as well as more sophisticated inserts.
Those paths are not implemented yet - the loader will error out if they are encountered.
